SteamFork Bug Tracker
======================

This tracker is for issues with SteamFork that cannot be recreated on a real Steam Deck with SteamOS.  SteamFork strives to be 100% bug compatible with SteamOS, as such do not open issues for features not available in SteamOS as they will be closed and your ability to participate may be removed.

When submitting a bug report, be sure to include the following:

1. A clear and concise description of the bug.
2. Any steps to recreate the bug.
3. Steps taken to verify the bug on a real Steam Deck.
4. Detail about the device being tested including manufacturer, model, processor, memory, and storage.

Bug reports without the required information will be closed and your ability to participate in reporting future bugs may be removed.
